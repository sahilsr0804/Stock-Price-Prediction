# Stock-Price-Prediction
- *Performed* time-series analysis on Nifty-50 stock prices, implementing *ARIMA, **Autoregressors, and deep learning models (LSTM* and *RNN) to predict the target variable **VWAP* using exogenous features.
- *Ensured* statistical significance of the best-fit models by evaluating *trends, seasonality, and stationarity* through decomposition and the *Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, and by conducting **autocorrelation analysis*.
- *Executed* feature engineering techniques like *moving average smoothing and rolling windows* to generate additional exogenous features, while verifying the absence of multicollinearity.
- *Validated* model performance using *RMSE* and *MAE* metrics, and concluded that deep learning models like *LSTM* outperformed traditional approaches, achieving an *RMSE of 0.046* and *MAE of 0.0370* .
